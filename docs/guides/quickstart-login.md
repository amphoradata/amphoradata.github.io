* The free individual plan gives you the essential functionality of Amphora Data. Its best if you want to quickly and easily access public data.
* The team plan adds support for more users, more data, and enhanced data governance. Its best if your team accesses and shares external data every day. 
* The institution plan adds support for sharing data internally within large institutions and has leading enterprise data management and control features. Its best if you want the benefits of bespoke data infrastructure and management tools without the cost.


### Create a new organisation (Team and Institution only)
> You only need to create an organisation if you sign up to a Team or Instition plan

If you're the first member of your organisation to sign up, then you'll need to create an [Amphora Data Organisation](../models/organisation.md). Creating an organisation is easy and quick.
