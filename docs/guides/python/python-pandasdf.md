## Pandas Data Frame

Pandas is a very popular Python package for working with data. [Pandas Data Frames](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) form the core of Pandas. Many data scientists love working with Data Frames, and many tools can import from this standard.

## Import the required modules

The `amphoradata` package does not come with pandas or numpy. You *must* install them yourself to use this module.

```sh
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
```

## Convert Signals to a Pandas DataFrame
You can convert signals to Dataframes very easily. First get the signal from the Amphora you want.
```py
client = AmphoraDataRepositoryClient(credentials)

# get a reference to an Amphora
amphora = client.get_amphora("e6097df0-952c-46a6-84b0-ccc29bf1b0f7")

# get a reference to the Amphora's signals
signals = amphora.get_signals()
```
We can now convert this entire signal to a dataframe
```
# download some signals and convert to a pandas dataframe
df = signals.pull().to_pandas()
print(df)

## Query specific times
Sometimes you will only want data from a specific interval. This is very easy to do. First set your desired time range
```
time_range = DateTimeRange(_from=start_time, to=end_time)
```
Note that you will need to import another model
```
from amphora_api_client import DateTimeRange
```
Now simply add that time range into the pull signal command
```
df = signals.pull(date_time_range=time_range).to_pandas()
```

## Other tips and tricks
Sometimes the time column will counterintuitively not be titled ``` t ```. This is because ```t``` is treated as an index. You can solve this by passing an option into the ```to_pandas`` as
```
df = signals.pull().to_pandas(t_as_index=False)
```
This also works if you want to query specific times.
