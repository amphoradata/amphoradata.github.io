> Amphora Data is currently in beta. These documents may change.

## Overview
Amphora Data maintains a real time ledger of all Amphora bought and sold. Appropriate subsets of this ledger are displayed to different organisations and forms the basis of monthly invoicing. As all users can both buy and sell Amphoras, your organisations balance may be positive or negative. 

At the end of the billing period, you may withdraw positive balances and are required to pay negative balances. Users in arrears after 30 days will have their accounts suspended or cancelled.

## View transactions
To view your organisations transactions, go to your organisation page. On the left hand side, click `Accounts` and you will be able to explore all your transactions

## View invoice
Your monthly invoice can be viewed on the organisation page or on a notification email.

## Pay invoice
Payments must be currently made through bank transfer. We will be deploying an embedded payments system shortly. 

## Withdraw credits
You can withdraw credits. Currently request this through billing@amphoradata.com and this will be processed. We will be deploying an embedded refund system shortly.
