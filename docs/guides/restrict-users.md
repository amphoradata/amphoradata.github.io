## Overview

You can set specific restrictions on who can and who can't access data for your own Amphoras on the public data repository.


## Method
To do this, go to ```Options``` on the Amphora page.

Then click ```Restricted Organisations```.

Now create a new restriction by clicking ```Restrict an Organisation``` in the top-right. Search the organisation you want to restrict then simply click ```Restrict Organisation```. 

Note that you can only restrict existing organisations on the Amphora platform. If there is a specific organisation, e.g. close competitor, that is not yet on Amphora but you want to restrict, please email isaac@amphoradata.com
