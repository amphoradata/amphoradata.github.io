> Amphora Data is currently in beta. These documents may change.

We believe in open source collaboration and a strong developer community. We publish code on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/amphoradata) and invite any contributors to publish there too!

If you want to contribute to an existing repositary, e.g. the python sdk, you can open a pull request to discuss and confirm changes with other collaborators in the repositary.

If you want to contribute to a new repositary, see if anyone in the community wants to join and create the repository in GitHub.

If you want to contribute some docs to this site, please reach out to rian@amphoradata.com
