You need to search the Amphora Data Catalogue to find the data you want. You need to purchase the Amphora after you find the one you want.

## Search with web app

To find an Amphora, click Discover in the header. This will take you to a list of all Amphoras on the platform. 

You can search this list multiple ways

## Search programmatically

You can search for Amphora with the python SDK. The command is
```py
search_for_amphorae
```
You can search for Amphora by labels, location, or a term. 

Full code for searching is below
```py
credentials = Credentials(username=your_username, password=your_password)
client = AmphoraDataRepositoryClient(credentials)

# Search by location
amphora_list = client.search_for_amphorae(lat = -28.641, lon = 153.445, dist = 50)

# Search by labels
amphora_list = client.search_for_amphorae(labels = 'forecast')

# Search by term

```

The search return is Boolean OR so it returns Amphora that match to your label search OR location search OR term search. We will expand this functionality in the future.
