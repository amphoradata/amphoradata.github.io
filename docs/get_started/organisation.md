When you registered, Amphora may have automatically created an Organisation for you. You can customise that Organisation by changing the name and description, adding members, or upgrading the plan.

Alternatively, you may wish to join an existing Organisation. In that case, you need an [Invitation](/users_orgs/invite-to-organisation.md) to join.

### Customise an Organisation

If you're the first member of your Organisation, or an Organisation administrator, then you can customise it.

### Join an existing Organisation (Team and Institution only)

If your organisation is already represented in Amphora Data, then you'll need to join that organisation. Click `Find my Organisation`, and search for the name of the Organisation.

Clicking `Join Organisation` will send a notice to your organisation admin who accept your request. If you've already been invited to an organisation, you should be automatically redirected to join that organisation.
