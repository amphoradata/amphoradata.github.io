Amphora Data is a modern real time data platform for storage, distribution, and collaboration. Data are containerised into Amphoras that provide a standardised management interface. Data access is centrally controlled and monitored. Amphora Data provides a web application, REST API, SDKs in Python and more. If you're distributing data in real time, then this is the tool for you.
