## How do I sign up?

You can sign up instantly and for free [here](https://identity.amphoradata.com/Register). After following the steps in the link you will be signed up to a Pay-as-you-go plan.

If you want to sign up to Amphora Glaze, select the Glaze plan in the Accounts page.

## How do I sell data?

You can list data for sale by
* [Creating a container](/share_data/create-amphora.md) for your data (an Amphora)
* [Uploading](/share_data/add-file.md) or [connecting](/share_data/add-signal.md) the data you went to sell

Your data will then be listed for sale. You will be notified if and when your data is sold. Data can be sold multiple times.


## When do I get paid?

We will start processing your payment within 24 hours of your data being bought by a verified user. Depending on your country and payments set up, you may be paid within 24 hours or the next business day.

## What data can I sell?

You can list data for sale that you own or have permission to sell. You are responsible for determining this and ensuring that the right terms of use and access controls are used for your data. You also must ensure your data contains no illegal or prohibited material.

You can list any type of data up to 100Gb per Amphora. Practically this means most data sets except Genomic and other very large data sets.

## Does Amphora verify or modify the data?

Amphora Data Pty Ltd doesn't verify or modify the data unless we have a specific agreement with your organisation. It is up to the data buyer to excercise due dilligence when buying data. It is up to the data seller to be as transparent as possible in describing the data for sale.

## What data can I buy?

You can in general buy any data on the Amphora Data marketplace. Some data sets are restricted to certain organisations (as determined by the data seller.) 

We currently predominantly have agricultural and ecological data for sale.

## What fees do I pay?

You don't pay any fees when you buy data, only the price of the Amphora. This is charged on a recurring basis.

If you sell data on our marketplace, we charge between 10% and 20% of the data price depending on how much data you sell.

Pricing for Amphora Glaze is still to be confirmed.

## What currency does Amphora use?

We are Australian based and use Australian dollars. We may extend this to other major currencies in the future.
