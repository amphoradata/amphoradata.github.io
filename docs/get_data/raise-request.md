Sometimes an Amphora contains only some of the data you want, or is in a format you're not familiar with. You can raise a request to the Amphora owner to create a new Amphora for you.

## Raise a data request

If you want specific data that isn't available on the Amphora platform, you can press the `I can't find what I'm looking for` button at the bottom of the `Discover` page. This will take you to the following page:

![Data request](/img/Data_request.PNG)

Simply fill out as much information as you can and click `Create`

This will raise a data request for all users of the platform to see.

## View existing data requests

You can view all existing data requests by clicking `Data Requests` on the `Discover` page. This returns a list of searchable data requests similar to the list of current Amphoras.
