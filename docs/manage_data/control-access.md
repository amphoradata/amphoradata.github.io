## Overview

You can set specific restrictions on who can and who can't access data for your own Amphoras on the public data repository.


## Method
To do this, go to ```Options``` on the Amphora page.

Then click ```Access Controls```. You can restrict Organisations with their organisation id. The Priority indicates the importance of the restriction placed on an organisation.

Note that you can only restrict existing organisations on the Amphora platform. If there is a specific organisation, e.g. close competitor, that is not yet on Amphora but you want to restrict, please email isaac@amphoradata.com
