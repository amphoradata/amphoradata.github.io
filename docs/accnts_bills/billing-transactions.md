## Overview
Amphora Data maintains a real time ledger of all Amphora bought and sold. Appropriate subsets of this ledger are displayed to different organisations and forms the basis of monthly invoicing. As all users can both buy and sell Amphoras, your organisations balance may be positive or negative. 

At the end of the billing period, you may withdraw positive balances and are required to pay negative balances. Users in arrears after 30 days will have their accounts suspended or cancelled.
